      I can’t wait to make new memories with you, and to share our lives together. You are my one and only, and I will never let you go.

Until then, know that you are always in my thoughts, in my heart, and in my soul. You are my angel, my star, and my treasure. You are my love, my life, and my everything.

With all my love, 
      vignesh ❤️
